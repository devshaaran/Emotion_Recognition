# Emotion_Recognition

A live emotion recognition tool made using Deep learning and openCV.

## Requirements

**1) OpenCV**

**2) Pytorch**

**3) Fastai**

**4) Python 3**

## Dataset and model

The dataset and the pre-trained model used have been uploaded in the Respository, if you would like to make your own model run the `make_model.py` file.

   ### Note
         The given model works on `Resnet34` architecture and I have used a pretrained model.
         
         

**What is a Pre-trained Model?**

   A pre-trained model has been previously trained on a dataset and contains the weights and biases that represent the features of whichever dataset it was trained on. Learned features are often transferable to different data. For example, a model trained on a large dataset of bird images will contain learned features like edges or horizontal lines that you would be transferable your dataset.

**Why use a Pre-trained Model?**

   Pre-trained models are beneficial to us for many reasons. By using a pre-trained model you are saving time. Someone else has already spent the time and compute resources to learn a lot of features and your model will likely benefit from it.
